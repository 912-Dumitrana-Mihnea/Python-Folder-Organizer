# File-Organizer
 
Fun little 'Quality of life" project I made in order to fix one of my real life struggles, the awful-looking Downloads folder. We all know it, the place where our browser throws downloaded stuff by default. Well say goodbye to the messy downloads folder now with the brand new "Python File Organizer".<br><br>
To run the script open Start.py and just select what you want to happen from the console-based menu!
